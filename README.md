## Description

This portfolio site is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, styled with Tailwind CSS, and deployed through GitHub Pages. Inspired by MySpace profile pages and pixel art aesthetics, the site features custom CSS animations, a static background, and anchor-based navigation for smooth scrolling. It is fully responsive and mobile-optimized, utilizing Tailwind's breakpoint system. The site dynamically pulls data from the GitHub API, including the my Github's profile picture, bio, and followers. It also includes links to GitHub projects, an embedded YouTube video with a transcription, a scrollable timeline, and an embedded song that can be muted or unmuted. Additional features include a downloadable PDF resume and a contact link for sending emails.

## Asignment Instructions

This assignment combines the interpersonal and technical lecture modules. This portfolio page will contain their biographies, stories (Maybe in a blog format), resumes, descriptions of the assignments and assessments they completed, any previous projects they built, and professional images of themselves. The students should develop their own user stories and design the portfolio site themselves. Each student will present their portfolio pages along with their stories and experiences through FastTrack'D to the class.

## Assignment Goal

Students will create their own portfolio page/site and prepare a presentation in which they will cover their experiences at FastTrack'D, their story which they have developed throughout the course, and their technical abilities by using their portfolio sites to effectively guide and support their presentation. This will serve as a great resource for representing each student individually and their experience throughout the lecture modules of FastTrack'D.
